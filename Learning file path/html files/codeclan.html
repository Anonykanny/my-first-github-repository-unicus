    <h3>Why knowing how to code is a key factor to transition into a new career and build your confidence </h3>
    <h4>The internet has become a part of almost every aspect of our lives. Weâ€™ve watched it change purely text based websites to adding pictures, including videos and have attempted to make websites more interactive and aesthetically pleasing. 

        Behind all websites and web-applications across sizes is a team of web designers and developers who are tasked with making sure that a website is both aesthetically appealing and functional. These days web-developers need to account for multiple factors when building websites, search engines and how websites are indexed, how the website needs to load on mobile devices and account for devices of different sizes when designing web-based experiences. 
        
        Just like having the ability to speak a foreign language, equipping yourself with basic HTML and CSS skills are helpful in almost all professions. These powerful coding languages are not only helpful to web developers but in any professional setting, basic knowledge of these languages could make a huge difference to you and your resume. </h4>
